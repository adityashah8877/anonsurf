# anonsurf
Internet not working after anonsurf
I am quite new in Linux in general. I decided to try running anonsurf and everything was fine, apart the fact that after stopping it - firefox stopped loading pages, internet connectivity works fine, i can ping google dns. And when i run anonsurf again - firefox works as well. I've checked basic stuff in the browser if any proxy settings are out there and cleared cache. Has anyone had similar issue?
