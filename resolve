// Every time I run anonsurf from the terminal or the gui my resolv.conf gets overridden. None of these previous answers worked for me. 
//The solution I found is this.


sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 1.1.1.1
ctrl-o ctrl-x

//if not working then again try this:

sudo dnstool address 8.8.8.8
